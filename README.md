# FINAL PROJECT: ShapeShifter
# 25 minute bodyweight workouts for Travelers

## All you need is a towel, a water bottle, a chair, and your computer.

After working in the fitness industry for the last 5 years, and talking with fitness-minded people and sitting in on many focus groups, I have realized there is a real need for an easy to use workout app for people who travel all the time. They get back to their hotel room and realize they want to do a workout but they really don't want to go out again and find a gym, or go to the hotel gym.

My final project is a 25 minute workouts for travelers. It can be done in your hotel room and will cover legs, arms and core exercises in a comprehensive challenge using only your bodyweight as resisitance. All you need is a towel, a water bottle, a chair, and your laptop.

It's designed to be easy to use while you are on the road and it operates on a 2 minute timed excercise, 30 second rest period for 10 exercises. 25 minutes and you are done.

I am going to build this in rails, and use jquery, javascript, CSS and HTML

Also used Skeleton, but I hate it. 
It says to get it in the url, but skip that.
